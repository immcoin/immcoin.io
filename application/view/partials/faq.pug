        #collapseFour.collapse(role='tabpanel', aria-labelledby='headingFour', data-parent='#accordion')
            .card-body Once per quarter on a pre-announced date, we will take 50% of the net profits generated by our education system and use it to buy back as many IMM Coin as we can. Holders will offer their iMM Coins for sale on the market and we will buy them back starting with the cheapest first. Once the buyback budget has been exhausted, all iMM Coins purchased within that budget will be permanently burned. This reduces the total remaining supply and increases the scarcity of the coins that remain.

                a(data-toggle='collapse', href='#collapseFive', aria-expanded='true', aria-controls='collapseTwo') HOW MUCH WILL CONTRIBUTORS MAKE?
        #collapseFive.collapse(role='tabpanel', aria-labelledby='headingFive', data-parent='#accordion')
            .card-body iMM Coin holders have to compete for the money on buy back day. Hence they can either set a low price and sell their IMM Coins more quickly, or set a higher price and wait longer for the market price to reach that level. This means a longer wait but a larger return. We cannot say what the return will be.
