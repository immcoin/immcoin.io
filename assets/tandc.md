Any participant is advised to read the iMM Coin White Paper which provides an explanation of the concept of iMM Coin, the purpose of iMM Coin and the unique benefits of holding i-MM Coin by a participant. These Terms and the white paper are not a solicitation for investment and the offering of i-MM Coin does not in any way offer any form of security or debenture in any jurisdiction. The ICO is a token sale which enables the Participant to a potential profit from buying i-MM Coin and from the sale of i-MM Coin at a later date to be determined at the Participant’s discretion. Participating in the purchase of i-MM Coin does not provide the holder with any rights, either express or implied in relation to the Interday Markets Management Limited. The ICO is to provide the Interday Markets Management Limited with immediately accessible funds raised from the ICO to develop iMM Coin and this is further explained in the White Paper.
    
### **1. Participant**

**1.1** It is assumed by the Interday Markets Management Limited that any Participant is of an expert and sophisticated nature and fully understands the workings of crypto currency, the blockchain and how an ICO works.

**1.2 In order for a Participant to participate, they agree that:**

1. They are over the age of 18 years (if domiciled in the HongKong) or are over the age of consent for a Participant to legally enter into a contract (if outside of the jurisdiction of the HongKong).

2. That they have sought the relevant legal, tax and regulatory advice from a suitably qualified professional as to the legality of an ICO in their jurisdiction.

3. That they understand that the ICO is not being offered to any Participant that resides in a jurisdiction that is regulated by laws of the countries where transactions with cryptocurrencies are restricted for example the United States of America. The Participant is solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all laws relevant in the jurisdiction in which they reside. The iMM Coin cannot be held liable for any legal risks and disputes arising from jurisdiction of the Participant.

4. That they are responsible to determine which, if any, taxes apply to any profits made and to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. The Interday Markets Management Limited is not obligated to determine which, if any, taxes apply and are not responsible to collect, report or remit any such taxes arising from profits earned by Participants.

5. That they will not participate in the ICO for any purposes related to organised crime, fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and financing terrorism. Participant’s understand that i-MM Coin will at all times co-operate with any police, criminal or relevant authority investigation relating to a Participant’s breach of these Terms.

6. That they are deemed to have the requisite experience to understand cryptocoins, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

7. They understand and agree that nothing in these Terms, nothing in the White Paper and nothing on the Website is intended to provide the Participant with investment, tax, accounting or legal advice or is to be interpreted as a recommendation, endorsement or enticement to participate with regards to i-MM Coin. Any decision by a Participant to participate is at their sole discretion and Interday Markets Management Limited will not be liable for any loss suffered.

8. That any purchase of i-MM Coin is non-refundable and is final.

9. That when the ICO launches, a public supply of 2,10,000,000 i-MM Coin will be listed for sale on the decentralised exchange.

10. By accepting these terms and conditions I certify and commit to any future participant identification which may be possible and legally required under money laundering regulations. It is currently impossible to verify with any certainty the individual purchasers of i-MM Coin by nature of their purchase on-line via bitcoins. The directors of i-MM Coin working with their specialist solicitors will endeavour to find a solution to this in due course. Interday Markets Management Limited are committed to ensuring best practice and working in accordance with any future regulatory body overseeing the relatively new space of cryptocurrency.
It is acknowledged that in accepting Bitcoin to participate in the i-MM Coin ICO purchasers have undergone anti money laundering processes via an exchange.

11. They will adhere to these Terms and agree to be bound by them.

### **2. Timetable for ICO**
    
**2.1** Timing of the ICO is as follows:

1. At 1st December 2017, the ICO will commence for a period of 120 days.

2. At 31st March 2018, the ICO will close.

3. At 2nd of April 2018 all i-MM Coin not sold in the ICO will be Burned. The Burn will be publicly visible.

**2.2** i-MM Coin reserve the right to extend the ICO for any reason, including, but not limited to, any unforeseen technical difficulties which hamper the original ICO timetable. If all i-MM Coin are sold prior to 31st March 2018 then the ICO will close at the point that the last i-MM Coin is sold.

### **3. Burning of IMMCOIN**

**3.1** A unique aspect of i-MM Coin is that each quarter, 50% of the net profits earned by the Interday Markets Management Limited from investing of the ICO funds will be used to buy back i-MM Coin directly from the market. Whilst there is no obligation on any Participant to sell their i-MM Coin, the purpose of the buy back is that upon Interday Markets Management Limited completing the buyback, all i-MM Coin subject to being bought back will be immediately Burned. This will result in a continuous reduction of the remaining supply of i-MM Coin and should result in a natural increase in the value.

**3.2** Proof of burn will be publicly visible.

**3.3** Buyback dates will be announced on the Website, well in advance of the buyback date in order that Participants have the opportunity to list their i-MM Coin for sale.

**3.4** Participants wishing to sell their i-MM Coin may list their i-MM Coin for sale on the market at their desired sale price (which will of course be subject to market conditions).

**3.5** The buyback process will have a limit of 30 years. This means that after the 31st March 2047 we will permanently cease the process of buying back and burning i-MM Coin.

### **4. Whole agreement**
